GPU monitoring tools show utilization percentages, but this can be misleading. A GPU reporting 100% utilization may actually be computing useful work, or wastefully stalled waiting on memory transfers, thermal throttling, or power limits. NVSonar analyzes real-time patterns from NVML metrics to identify what's actually limiting your GPU performance.

## Features

- Bottleneck classification (compute-bound, memory-bandwidth-bound, memory-capacity-bound, power-limited, thermal-throttled, data-starved)
- Temporal pattern detection (clock oscillation, temperature trends, utilization dips, memory leaks)
- Multi-GPU outlier detection via Z-scores
- Health scoring with A-F grades (0-100 per GPU)
- Throttle bitmask decoder with severity levels
- PCIe link degradation and ECC error monitoring
- Actionable recommendations with specific commands
- GPU performance benchmarks (memory bandwidth, compute throughput, PCIe speed)
- Historical tracking with trend analysis over time
- Session monitoring Python API for workload profiling
- JSON and CSV output for automation and scripting

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- NVIDIA GPU with driver installed
- Linux
